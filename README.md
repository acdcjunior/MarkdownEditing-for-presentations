# MarkdownEditing for presentations

This is a fork of [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing) that changes some stuff and adds recognition (and syntax highlighting) of some patterns that appear in presentations made using markdown and reveal.js.

### Installation (manual)

2. On the `Packages` folder:
